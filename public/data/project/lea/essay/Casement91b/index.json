It is well known that when projection  (simple) is operating, the projector disowns some aspect of the self  and attributes this to another. Evidence of that projection is usually  to be noticed in the projector relating differently to the other  person (or outside world) in terms of what has been projected. The  recipient, or observer, may otherwise be quite unaware of any  projection operating. What is foremost here is the projector's need  to disown some aspect of himself.","pg":4,"col":"white","did":"eba4e085e247849e8b2fb5ffc5cbbfad"},{"type":"Excerpt","text":"When projective identification is used as a form ofaffective cony  raunication, the projector has a need (usually unconscious) to make  another person aware of what is being communicated and to be  responded to.","pg":4,"col":"blue","did":"713f74edefb88b521b95a9712ca0a8f1"},{"type":"Excerpt","text":"If the recipient is open to the  impact of the interactional behavior, or other non-verbal pressures  from the projector, an affective communication is achieved.
